Selection sort

Scan from left to right
Find the smallest item and swap it with the right index then go for the next
In each iteration it select the smallest unsorted element from the array and move it to the right place

Best case - O(n^2)
Worst case - O(n^2)

its not an efficient sorting algorithm
