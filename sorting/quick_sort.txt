Quick sort

Quick sort is an efficient sorting algorithm
It select a pivot value and then it partition the array in to two using that pivot.
The left side of the array will be elements less than pivot and right side of the pivot will be greater than the pivot

Best case - O(n log n)
Worst case - O(n^2)
Space complexity - O(n)

Quick sort use less space than merge sort
