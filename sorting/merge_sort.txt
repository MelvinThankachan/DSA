Merge sort

In Merge sort we divide the list to sub-list then sort them
in the end we merge all the sorted sub-lists in order to sort the entire list 
divide and conquer

Need additional space to store the sub arrays

Best case - O(log n)
Worst case - O(n log n)
Space complexity - O(n)

Merge sort is an efficient algorithm
