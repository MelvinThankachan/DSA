Stacks

Applications
1. Implement the undo feature
2. Build compilers (eg: syntax checking)
3. Evaluate expressions(eg: 1 + 2 * 3)
4. Build navigation (eg: forward/backward)

Stack of books
Last In First Out(LIFO)
Insertion and deletion happens in the same end.

Operations:
1. push(item)   - O(1)
2. pop()        - O(1)
3. peek()       - O(1)
4. is_empty()   - O(1)

We can use in undo or operations perform in reverse order
Can implement using arrays and deque
All operations are O(1)
